### CLI Integration

```bash
# New command added
labelforge web [--port PORT] [--host HOST]

# Help and documentation
labelforge web --help
```

### Dependencies Management

Added new optional dependency group:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
web = [
    "streamlit>=1.28.0",
    "plotly>=5.15.0", 
    "altair>=5.0.0",
    "streamlit-aggrid>=0.3.4",
]
```

## üî¨ Research Focus

The interface is specifically designed for academic and research use:

- **Systematic Experimentation**: Support for testing multiple labeling strategies
- **Conflict Analysis**: Advanced tools for studying function disagreements  
- **Reproducible Research**: Export capabilities for sharing results
- **Educational Value**: Interactive learning tool for weak supervision concepts
- **Community Collaboration**: Visual interface for demonstrating research

## üìà Impact and Benefits

### For Researchers
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: No coding required for basic experimentation
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick testing of labeling strategies
- **Visual Insights**: Immediate feedback on function performance
- **Collaboration**: Easy demonstration to colleagues and students

### For Practitioners  
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface for domain experts
- **Production Ready**: Export capabilities for ML pipelines
- **Quality Control**: Visual inspection of labeling quality
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets with performance optimization

### For the LabelForge Project
- **Community Growth**: More accessible to broader user base
- **Research Adoption**: Easier integration into academic workflows
- **Documentation**: Living examples of framework capabilities
- **Future Development**: Foundation for advanced features

## ‚úÖ Testing and Validation

- **Functional Testing**: Successfully launched and tested all features
- **Integration Testing**: All existing tests continue to pass
- **Performance Testing**: Tested with sample datasets up to 10K examples
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and clear feedback

## üöÄ Next Steps

With the web interface complete, the project is now positioned for:

1. **Advanced Model Diagnostics** (next roadmap item)
2. **ML Framework Integration** 
3. **Community Feedback Integration**
4. **Performance Optimizations**
5. **Documentation and Tutorials**

## üìù Documentation Created

- **Web Interface README**: Comprehensive usage guide
- **Demo Script**: Interactive demonstration tool
- **CLI Documentation**: Updated command reference
- **Integration Examples**: Sample workflows and use cases

## üéâ Conclusion

The web interface represents a major milestone in making LabelForge accessible to the broader research community. It transforms the framework from a code-only tool to a comprehensive research platform that serves both technical and non-technical users.

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between powerful programmatic labeling capabilities and user-friendly interfaces, enabling wider adoption in academic and research settings.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Ready for community use and feedback!
